Hi,

I'm Mayuddin Bhuiyan from Bangladesh.

I'm a Frontend Developer with over 2 years of experience.
I love to code and create web elements for amazing people around the world. I like to work with new people forgather new experiences.

I already completed a web development course with Jhankar Mahbub. and, learned a lot from that course.

Such as:

Html,Css,JavaScript,Bootstrap,Material-Ui,MongoDB,FireBase,React,Node and So On.





I design and develop services for customers of all sizes, specializing in creating stylish, modern websites, web services, and online stores.





In most of the cases I, face several problems,

One day I was practicing it. and came across a problem, and after looking at my old code and video I couldn't solve it.
then I go to google and write the problem and it's solved.

Now,
I face any problems, firstly I go to my friend google and, he shows me the right way.


Bullet points:
--------------

Building a high-converting online store, Design Theory, Managing Products, and Inventory, SEO and Conversion Rate Optimization.


That's Why I'm not afraid of any problems now,



That's
